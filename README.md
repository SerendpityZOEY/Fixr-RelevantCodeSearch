# SolrProject

This application uses ReactJS to connect with Solr and fetching data. Also used Material UI and Materializecss.

## First Time Setup
If you already have npm and node installed, you can skip this step.
For Ubuntu:
```
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install nodejs
$node -v
$sudo apt-get install npm
$npm -v
```
For Mac:
 
1. Open the Terminal app and type `brew install node`.
2. Sit back and wait. Homebrew downloads some files and installs them. And thatâ€™s it.
